# Grammar: The Passive Voice

### The Impersonal Passive Voice structure is used for:

Things that are thought, believed, said or reported.

We form it like this:

* It + be + past participle of reporting verb + that + clause

"It is believed that the test have produced false positives."

### With Personal Passive sentences:

We often use verbs like: believe, expect, find, know, report, say, think, or understand.

We form it like this:

Subject + Passive Verb + to-Infinitive

"The tests are known to produce false positives."
